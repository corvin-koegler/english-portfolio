## Abstract
## Introduction

Software development and construction share many parallels and have historically been treated mostly the same. This historically extends to the project lifecycles. In the early days of software developers had to write large amounts of their code on paper because computer time was scarce and machines where still slow. Just like construction the job of the architect and the construction worker (programmer) were separated because both jobs called for a different skillset. The project got constructed on paper iterated on by multiple experts in different phases and ultimately constructed with the difference being that one field worked with steel and concrete and the other with text inputs.

In construction one of the most popular design approaches is the waterfall concept where the project flows down the different steps and then ends in a maintainenc
