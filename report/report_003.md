## Evolution

Few software products are developed once, deployed, and then never altered again. Most are in a state of constant evolution, with weekly or even nightly builds being released to users. In this context, it is beneficial to review the evolution of a project, analyzing how it has changed over time and identifying the external and internal factors that have led to improvements or setbacks.

### Visualizing Software Evolution

Visual tools, integrated with basic Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems, represent a significant advancement in the field. By using dense pixel techniques, these tools can display information on hundreds of versions of hundreds of files on a single screen, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's evolution (Voinea & Telea, 2009). Such visualizations help in understanding the trajectory of the project and identifying trends and patterns that might not be apparent through raw data alone.

### Employee Insights

At the employee level, visualizing the evolution of a software project can help identify quality contributors and ensure they are recognized and retained. Developers who feel unseen and unvalued are more likely to consider switching jobs, potentially harming the project’s continuity and development. By analyzing contributions and performance, project managers can allocate resources and budget more effectively, retaining valuable talent and improving overall team morale. Additionally, recognizing and responding to recurring positive or negative patterns in real-time can enhance team productivity and project outcomes.

### Technical Insights

On a technical level, larger projects often leverage libraries and frameworks to incorporate frequently needed functionality. These dependencies, which are continuously developed, might introduce breaking changes or deprecate certain features. Without a clear overview of these potential changes, the stability of production code can be jeopardized. Raw repository information, when displayed directly, offers limited insight into the evolution of a software project. Therefore, extra analysis is needed to process this data and extract relevant evolutionary features (Voinea & Telea, 2009).

Managing the evolution of a project includes tracking how libraries and frameworks evolve. It’s a tedious job to manually crawl through all existing code when a library announces deprecations, and it’s a security hazard to continue using outdated versions without security updates. Visual tools can highlight these dependencies and potential issues, allowing developers to proactively address them and maintain the stability and security of their codebase.

In conclusion, visualizing the evolution of a software project provides significant insights at both the employee and technical levels. By leveraging advanced visualization tools, teams can better understand project dynamics, recognize valuable contributions, and maintain the integrity of their code over time.
