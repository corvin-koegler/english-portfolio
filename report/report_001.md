### 3D vs 2D

#### Thought dump

Existing tools tend to utilize 3D environments to visualize codebases with the argument that humans evolved to navigate a three dimensional world and therefor 3d visualizations should be most intuitive to use. While the information density generally benefits from the extra dimension most seem to ignore that applications are traditionally 2D as are the tools to navigate them. Without a background in 3d videogames or 3D modelling software the interactions on the computer are limited to 2 dimensions. While VR and AR might change that in the future, we are in the immediate future still bound to 2D applications like mail programs, most websites and text editors. At this point it becomes a point of target audience. If we design for users who have no prior experience with computers the 3d environment might temporarily be more intuitive to use. But due to the expectation of targeting programmers and adjacent roles in the tech industry it makes sense to assume at least some prior interactions with text editors, chat programs, news sites or other tools, all of whom are 2d. Additionally, a 3d interface might obstruct certain elements due to the projection of a 3d world on a 2d screen. This means interaction is needed to view all information instead of a short glimpse to get a rough picture.

#### Improved via AI

The prevalent use of 3D environments for visualizing codebases is often justified by the argument that humans have evolved to navigate a three-dimensional world, and therefore, 3D visualizations should be more intuitive. While it is true that the additional dimension can enhance information density, many such tools overlook a critical consideration: most applications and interaction tools are traditionally two-dimensional.

For individuals without a background in 3D video games or 3D modelling software, computer interactions are typically limited to two dimensions. Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) hold potential for future changes, the immediate landscape remains dominated by 2D applications such as email programs, websites, and text editors. This introduces a significant point regarding the target audience for these tools.

When designing for users with no prior computer experience, a 3D environment might temporarily seem more intuitive. However, considering that the target audience for code visualization tools generally consists of programmers and professionals in adjacent tech fields, it is reasonable to assume they have considerable experience with 2D interfaces. These users are accustomed to 2D interactions through text editors, chat programs, news sites, and other tools. Consequently, a 3D interface could potentially hinder their productivity rather than enhance it.

Moreover, a 3D interface projected onto a 2D screen can obscure certain elements, requiring interaction to view all the information. In contrast, a 2D interface allows users to quickly scan and grasp a comprehensive view without additional navigation. This efficiency is critical for developers who need to understand complex codebases swiftly and effectively.

Additionally, the cognitive load associated with learning and navigating a new 3D interface may outweigh its potential benefits. Familiarity with 2D tools allows users to leverage existing skills and workflows, facilitating a smoother and faster adaptation process. The transition to 3D environments could introduce unnecessary friction and reduce overall efficiency.

In summary, while 3D visualizations offer increased information density, their practical application is limited by the predominant use of 2D interfaces in professional environments. For an audience well-versed in 2D interactions, maintaining a 2D visualization approach ensures accessibility, efficiency, and a lower cognitive load, ultimately fostering a more productive experience.
