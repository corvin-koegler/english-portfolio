## Applications of Software Visualization in modern Projects

When thinking about construction we find it natural to begin any project of reasonable size and complexity with a rough design. Afterwards the design iterates through multiple steps to refine it, check it's physical properties and how it fits into the scenery. Only then construction starts ideally realizing the project exactly as planned. These steps are known as a waterfall design approach. Most properties of a step have to be refined before continuing with the next one. In the early days of software engineering this was the exact approach used as well. Programmers spent more time  iterating their design on paper instead of typing code but other than buildings and bridges environment and expectations of software applications became more and more dynamic. In recent days most large scale projects have to be designed in record time while having to conform to longevity, reusability and an abundance of other criterions. Processes in the top companies are now agile and code has to be modular to reduce dependencies when switching components for the next weekly release. At some point the common visual aids became solely educational at least for programmers. Everything that keeps you from maximizing code output has to be reduced to a minimum. At this point frameworks rise and fall in a matter of months while the projects using them ideally live significantly longer. And within that the saying that the most permanent code is the one that was only to be a quick fix still holds it's truth.

One of the biggest struggles new hires of an established team have is understanding the existing code, working through mind numbing amounts of code in varying state of decay trying to add to the existing features without breaking them accidentally. Speaking from experience the old UML diagrams would come in handy right now. In many teams getting up to speed is a matter of months because the options are working through the existing code or consistently depend on others to integrate your code. With AI inching closer to write it's own projects only being restraint by it's memorisable context the second one becomes less and less viable. In construction the visual aids have mostly kept up with demand. It's time for software visualization to rise again. Question is how and what to visualize effectively.
