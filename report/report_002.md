## Applications of Software Visualization in modern Projects

When thinking about construction we find it natural to begin any project of reasonable size and complexity with a rough design. Afterwards the design iterates through multiple steps to refine it, check it's physical properties and how it fits into the scenery. Only then construction starts ideally realizing the project exactly as planned. These steps are known as a waterfall design approach. Most properties of a step have to be refined before continuing with the next one. In the early days of software engineering this was the exact approach used as well. PRogrammers spent more time
