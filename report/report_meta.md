## Research Themes

- **Architectural Smells and Anti-patterns**: Research on identifying and visualizing architectural smells (e.g., cyclic dependencies, high coupling) and anti-patterns can help in understanding and addressing architecture issues.
- **Visualizing Dependencies**: Dependency visualization helps in identifying problematic dependencies that can affect the modularity and maintainability of the code.
- **Evolution and Maintenance**: Studies on visualizing the evolution of software architectures can help in identifying architectural drift and erosion over time.
- **Tool Support for Architecture Visualization**: Development and evaluation of tools that support architecture visualization and analysis.
