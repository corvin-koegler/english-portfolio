Existing tools tend to utilize 3D environments to visualize codebases with the argument that humans evolved to navigate a three dimensional world and therefor 3d visualizations should be most intuitive to use. While the information density generally benefits from the extra dimension most seem to ignore that applications are traditionally 2D as are the tools to navigate them. Without a background in 3d videogames or 3D modelling software the interactions on the computer are limited to 2 dimensions. While VR and AR might change that in the future, we are in the immediate future still bound to 2D applications like mail programs, most websites and text editors. At this point it becomes a point of target audience. If we design for users who have no prior experience with computers the 3d environment might temporarily be more intuitive to use. But due to the expectation of targeting programmers and adjacent roles
