## Purpose

Tests evaluate the state of a system. This includes subjective criteria like acceptance testing as well as objective criteria like unit tests. There are software development strategies revolved around writing tests. Popular is Test-Driven-Development (TDD) where the developer defines the behaviour of a unit first by writing tests and then writes the actual functionality frequently evaluating it against the tests. This creates some overhead in the development process but in most cases reduces the time spent on debugging and documentation. 

## Specific Tests

| Word                | Definition                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Alpha testing       | The first testing iteration within the organization.                     |
| Beta testing        | The testing iteration with a select small group of customers.            |
| Black-Box testing   | Testing functionality without focus on the internal structure.           |
| Unit testing        | Testing of the smallest units against known behaviour.                   |
| Integration testing | Testing the integration of a module with the existing sytsem.            |
| Functional testing  | Tests against functional requirements.                                   |
| System testing      | Testing the system as a whole.                                           |
| Acceptance testing  | Testing the product against core user groups.                            |
| Regression testing  | Running existing tests to detect new features breaking existing modules. |
| Performance testing | Running benchmarks against units and modules.                            |
| Security testing    | Testing the system against known security vulnerabilities.               |
| A/B testing         | Testing a change against two groups of users.                            |
| White-Box testing   | Tests aimed purely at internal systems and logic.                        |
