## Purpose

Tests evaluate the state of a system. This includes subjective criteria like acceptance testing as well as objective criteria like unit tests. There are software development strategies revolved around writing tests. Popular is Test-Driven-Development (TDD) where the developer defines the behaviour of a unit first by writing tests and then writes the actual functionality frequently evaluating it against the tests. This creates some overhead in the development process but in most cases reduces the time spent on debugging and documentation. 

## Specific Tests

| Word                | Definition                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Alpha testing       | The initial testing phase conducted within the organization to identify bugs before releasing the product to external users. |
| Beta testing        | A testing phase where a select small group of customers evaluates the software in a real-world environment to provide feedback and identify issues not caught during alpha testing. |
| Black-Box testing   | A testing approach that focuses on the functionality of the software without considering the internal code structure. The tester only knows the inputs and expected outputs. |
| Unit testing        | Testing of the smallest, individual units of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they perform as expected. |
| Integration testing | Testing the interaction between integrated units or modules to ensure they work together as intended within the existing system. |
| Functional testing  | Testing the software against its functional requirements to ensure it performs the intended tasks. |
| System testing      | Testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. |
| Acceptance testing  | Evaluating the product by core user groups or customers to determine whether it meets their needs and is ready for production. |
| Regression testing  | Re-running previously conducted tests to ensure that new changes or features have not introduced any new bugs or broken existing functionality. |
| Performance testing | Assessing the software's performance, including speed, responsiveness, and stability under various conditions. |
| Security testing    | Identifying vulnerabilities within the system to ensure it is protected against potential threats and attacks. |
| A/B testing         | Comparing two versions of a feature or product with two groups of users to determine which version performs better based on predefined criteria. |
| White-Box testing   | A testing approach that examines the internal structure and workings of the software, often performed by developers who have knowledge of the codebase. |
