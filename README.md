Hello there,
this is my study portfolio for English class. On that note I'm not sure how to feel about the [Vocab](/vocab) section. I feel like I'm struggling to keep words in active memory and have not found a good system except talking more.

I was a little lazy with my media log especially with actually remembering to put items in there. So I went back and added some videos I was watching anyways. These don't have timestamps. Most courses this semester use English  but it didn't feel right to include that under 'media' as well. Hope this is still alright.
