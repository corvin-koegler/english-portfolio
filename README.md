Hello there,
this is my study portfolio for English class. On that note I'm not sure how to feel about the [Vocab](/vocab/) section. I feel like I'm struggling to keep words in active memory and have not found a good system except talking more with native speakers.

I was a little lazy with my media log especially with actually remembering to put items in there. So I went back and added some videos I was watching anyways. These don't have timestamps. Most courses this semester use English but it didn't feel right to include that under 'media' as well. Hope this is still alright.

For the best reading experience please use the obsidian text editor (I used it to write this) or stay on the gitlab site and read the formatted version from there. I have used markdown to keep it consistent.

Thank you for the amazing course.
Corvin
