## Quotation

Quoting is the act of referencing someone else's work. The quote text is enclosed in quotation marks or formatted as a blockquote. The original author is to be cited and the text shall not be manipulated. Both quotation marks go on the top of the text. Choose either single or double quotation marks and keep it consistent.

An embedded quotation is mixing the quote with original content. For this purpose we are allowed to change some grammar of the original for aesthetic purposes. Changed text needs to be highlighted with brackets.

The volume of quotes in the essay should follow the PEE principle (Point Example Explain).

## Citing and referencing

Academic texts are bound to evidence and information that is backed by sources. When using source information the origin must be cited.
