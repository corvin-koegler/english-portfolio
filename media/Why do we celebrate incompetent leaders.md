## Overview

Martin Gutmann is a management historian who talks about the contrast of perception between good and bad leadership. His main point is that leaders who manoeuvre themselves into trouble and then barely escape the self inflicted troubles are celebrated instead of sustainable "boring" and future oriented leaders. His main reason for that is that we as a society prefer good stories over good leaders.  

- Action Fallacy
	- Noisy leaders are confused with good leaders
	- Good leadership creates bad stories
