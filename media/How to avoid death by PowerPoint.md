## Overview

David Phillips talks about the misleading and counterproductive standards of modern PowerPoint-Presentations. Main flaw being information overload and attention seeking design.

- One message per slide
- Headlines smaller than content
- Contrast of PowerPoint and presenter should favour presenter
	- dark background
	- selective contrast
- No more than six objects on a slide
- No sentences
- Use size for focus
