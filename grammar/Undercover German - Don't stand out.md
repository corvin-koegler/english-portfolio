I'm gaming online with a international (European) group of friends. All of them are quite good English speakers although none of us are natives. Here is a list of mistakes I got taunted for during some sessions (because I asked them too. Gaming as an excuse for uni is great).

I have shortened most of them and used different examples when we were talking about game specific things. 

1. I'm omitting some articles when the game gets heated. For example  "I have car" instead of "I have *a* car". I have no idea why this is happening.
2. "I am good in English" was literally my second sentence. I know better "I am (allegedly) good at English"
3. "Yesterday, to the store I went" No one believes me that this was on purpose. On the list it goes "Yesterday, I went to the store"
4. "I have seen him yesterday" I blame this one on being a German. It's in my blood. "I saw him yesterday"
5. "If I would know, I would tell you" I think this is a common mistake. It took proof from Grammarly.com to convince me that it actually is one.  "If I knew, I would tell you". It seems to be a uncommon saying as well.
6. "I must to go now" This is just embarrassing. But now I know what modal verbs are. "I must go now"
7. "Chef" in German means "boss," not "cook." Saying "Yes Chef" got me the nick name Ramsey.
8. "I will jump over my shadow" < "I will go the extra mile". When things get heated I'm translating literally. Makes some funny moments.
9. "ship" vs. "sheep." This was a pronunciation issue. A battle sheep in the cutscene would have been cuter tho.
10. "CONduct" vs. "conDUCT". Apparently one is about electricity and one about behaviour.
11. Skipping small talk can come across as rude or abrupt. I was forced to include this.

Someone in a random online lobby asked if I was Swedish. In my book Swedish people have a great accent. It seemed to be a temporary improvement and most could tell my heritage right away.
